### Project Description
The project is designed to create a website that only unlocks access when the user smiles. Using computer vision, the site detects a happy expression through the webcam, adding an engaging, interactive layer to website access.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This project solves the "serious-face syndrome" by ensuring that only those with a smile can enter! Forget passwords; we‚Äôre replacing them with positivity and adding a bit of joy to the internet. It‚Äôs the ultimate smile check-in! üòÑ

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre turning your camera into a smile detector! No grumpy faces allowed‚Äîif you want access, you‚Äôve got to flash those pearly whites. With some clever computer vision, the site checks for smiles like a virtual bouncer, opening up only for those who bring the good vibes!1
